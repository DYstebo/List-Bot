# List-Bot
List-Bot can randomly choose a user-specified amount of either unique or non-unique

your favorite sports teams, numbers, or anything else you'd like! Use `/help` to get started!

/delete [List or Entries] [List name] [Entries separated by spaces, not required if deleting a list]

/set [List name] [Entries separated by spaces, will overwrite current entries]

/list [List name, optional. Not including a list will get return all Lists]

/urandom [list] [number of unique items to return]
